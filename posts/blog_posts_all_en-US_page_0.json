If you upload the video as Private, it's&nbsp;possible you could receive a monetization claim on your video.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For uploading the content on other platforms, refer to the channel\u2019s platform policies for tips on how to avoid copyright strikes.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\nAlthough unlikely, if you do receive a claim on any SAC content, there may be a short delay in YouTube processing the release of the claim.

The general recommendation is to disable VODs/clips when streaming Fortnite Festival.

All current and future Jam Tracks now have these two&nbsp;playable song parts, accessible on the Main Stage with a guitar controller.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Pro Lead and Pro Bass have hammer-on and pull-off notes. When you have a streak going, you can hit these notes without strumming!</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Pro Lead and Pro Bass have colored notes for each lane, corresponding with the guitar controller's&nbsp;buttons.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Leaderboards now have new listings to support Pro Lead and Pro Bass scores. Climb to the top!</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To support the release of Pro Lead and Pro Bass, we\u2019ve updated the Overdrive color <em>for all song parts</em> from bright orange to silver-white. How you gather and activate Overdrive hasn\u2019t changed, but we felt with the added note colors that Overdrive needed to appear more distinct.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For now, the whammy bar only provides a visual effect. There is no audio distortion or extra Overdrive energy when whammying.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>We\u2019re continuing to improve the feel of playing with a guitar controller and want your feedback! For rhythm-rocking veterans, there may be situations where you miss a note you\u2019d expected to hit, or where a familiar Jam Track feels different. Let us know your thoughts as you don the axe in Fortnite Festival. We\u2019re excited to see you shred!</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br />\nTuning Up</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Music Library now shows an expanded set of stats, showing your selected Instrument type\u2019s best performance in each Jam Track row.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Music Library is now also ordered with new and featured Jam Tracks at the top by default (this can be re-sorted), allowing players with large libraries to easily access Quest-relevant Jam Tracks.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>New Wristband Quests and rewards have been added.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Season 2 leaderboard scores have been recorded and archived. The leaderboards await your new top performances with Season 3!&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For more convenient song selection, you'll be closer to the organ when you arrive Backstage. No more sprinting to make your setlist!</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>There are more stats on the Results screen after each performance. You can now see the percentage of notes hit and missed and the average from your other performances to see how you\u2019ve improved.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>We\u2019ve reordered the song parts selection menu to Vocals &gt; Bass &gt; Lead &gt; Drums.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>We fixed a bug that was granting a \u201cDouble Overdrive\u201d meter during certain note sections.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Made various other fixes and improvements.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n",

Players who choose this will see a player using the Emote standing still, with no Emote sound.<br />\n<br />\nThe See Confrontational Emotes setting applies to four Emotes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Laugh It Up</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Take the L</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Whipcrack</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Make It Plantain</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\nThe new setting can be found under \u201cSocial Privacy\u201d and will default to only show these Emotes from friends in your party. You can change this setting any time, so you can see these Emotes from ANY player or not at all.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"English\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/english-1920x982-8925da4c2e51.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Note:</strong> This setting does not change a player's ability to <em>use</em> any Emotes.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>LEGO\u00ae Fortnite seems ripe for another major update. Nay, a content harvest! Turn animals into friends and populate your Villages\u2019 acres in v29.30 (a.k.a. the <strong>Farm Friends</strong> update), which brings animal recruitment and major Village improvements to your world\u2019s pleasant pastures.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nGet those Shovels ready because you\u2019re gonna dig this one. Farm Friends launches April 23!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite FarmFriends\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-farmfriends-1920x1080-663b9c89512e.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nThe Animals are Ready to Mooooooooooooove In&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>It\u2019s never lonely at the farm! The Farm Friends update increases the Village recruitment cap to ten per Village. Three Village slots are available to Villagers, three slots are available to animals, and four slots are available to Villagers OR animals.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAnimals you can recruit to your Village include cows, sheep, chickens, and a new animal arriving with this update: pigs!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite FeedingPigs\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-feedingpigs-1920x1080-a93028dc0641.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nHow to Tame and Recruit Animals&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>1. Build an Animal House</strong>&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nYou\u2019ll need to gain the trust of wild animals before you can lead them back to your Village. But before they\u2019re ready to follow you, you\u2019re gonna need to build them a new home: an <strong>Animal House</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Animal House is a new Station, made for feeding your animals and farming resources. You\u2019ll unlock the Animal House recipe once your Village reaches Level 2!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite AnimalHouse\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-animalhouse-1920x1080-0a66a0d2ef5a.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. A Friend with Feed is a Friend Indeed&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe way to an animal\u2019s heart is through its stomach. Build the trust of wild animals by petting them, then gain their friendship by giving them an <strong>Animal Treat</strong>! Unlock the recipe for Animal Treats by building an Animal House.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite AnimalGivingHearts\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-animalgivinghearts-1920x1080-f59f49c0f0cc.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>&nbsp;3. Be the Shepherd</strong><br />\n<br />\nIf the animal accepts your delicious treat, you\u2019ve got a limited amount of time to get them back to your Village. Make sure their journey back is a peaceful one \u2014 any unpleasant encounters could upset them so much that they give you the hoof!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nGet creative with how you lead an animal back to your Village. Lure them into a vehicle for a quick journey, use a Fishing Rod to pull them across tight spots, or cross barriers by building bridges! If the animal gets hurt on the journey, make sure to heal them by giving them another Animal Treat.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite SheepBeach\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-sheepbeach-1920x1080-32a45ff98552.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>4. Assign Animals to Animal Houses and Keep Them Happy!&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\nWhen you\u2019ve braved the journey back, it\u2019s time to put a roof over your new companion\u2019s head! Interact with an Animal House to assign your animal its new home, and to name it from a selection of names. (Only one animal can be assigned per Animal House.)&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nOnce they\u2019re settled in, it\u2019s your job to ensure they enjoy life on the farm. Keep your animals happy by feeding them, petting them, or having a boogie next to them! You can also build objects for them to interact with.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Piginhome\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-piginhome-1920x1080-85b3598bffd7.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nIf your animals feel ignored, they won\u2019t stick around for long. We recommend assigning a Villager to take good care of them when you\u2019re not around!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nResources Galore&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>We reap what we sow. Take good care of your animals and you\u2019ll be rewarded with new resources to help you out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>Chickens produce <strong>Feathers</strong> and <strong>Fertilizer</strong> over time.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>Cows produce <strong>Milk</strong> and <strong>Fertilizer</strong> over time.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>Sheep produce <strong>Wool</strong> and <strong>Fertilizer</strong> over time.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Pigs produce <strong>Mushrooms</strong> and <strong>Fertilizer</strong> over time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nNew Villagers&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Five new Villagers are ready to lend a helping hand and separate the wheat from the chaff! <strong>Cadence</strong> is a master woodworker, <strong>Ash</strong> is wild about plants, and <strong>Brooks</strong> is all about channeling nature\u2019s beat!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As for the bright and cheerful engineer <strong>Lana Llane</strong>, she can\u2019t wait to settle in a Village and find some new projects to work on. And then there\u2019s <strong>Guernsey</strong>. Guernsey is\u2026 one of a kind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nBeware the Bear!</h2>\n\n<p>Farm Friends is all about making new friends, whether they\u2019re animals or Villagers. That said, not <em>all</em> of the animals like to play nice\u2026&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Bear\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-farmfriends-bear-1920x1080-47cf642f711c.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nBear = bad. Don\u2019t let Bears follow you back to your Village because you\u2019ll never hear the end of it. Thankfully, they\u2019re quite sleepy and can be easily avoided\u2026 as long as you\u2019re quiet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nNew Animal Variants</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Animal Variants\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-animal-variants-1920x1080-3bc7c1923bfe.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nFarming has never looked so fantastic.

Different <em>Series</em> of cosmetics \u2014 such as the Icon Series or Gaming Legends Series \u2014 will still be there to help you find your favorite stuff!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nUpcoming: Shop Rotation Dates for Individual Cosmetics</h2>\n\n<p>We recently removed the overall Shop refresh timer, and instead show the Shop rotation time in every player\u2019s unique time zone. Beginning in late May 2024, we will also add the planned date that every individual item will rotate out of the Shop to the item\u2019s description page.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThanks for reading!</p>\n",

Just like how Rocket Racing is all about racing without limits, we wanted to treat Rocket Racing development the same way. So with that in mind, we decided not to approach major updates as typical \u201cSeasons.\u201d Instead, we want to introduce themed content while leaving room for features that go beyond the overall theme.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, Neon Rush has neon-themed courses, but also celebrates creator-made tracks and brings the small-town \u201cSlap Happy\u201d track.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThere\u2019s something for everyone in Neon Rush, and we want future major updates to take their own exciting roads!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMajor Improvements, Adjustments, and Bug Fixes</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Rocket Racing Delirium\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-delirium-3840x2160-d157fad32c62.png\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\nRanked Racing, Matchmaking, and Leaderboards</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Ranked Progression Balancing</strong>: Alongside the rank reset, we are making adjustments to progress gains in ranked play.

            "content": "<p>Heya Commanders! The <strong>Scurvy Shoals</strong> Venture Season has come ashore in Save the World, and brings <strong>Survive the Horde</strong> back into the fray with tons of updates and improvements. Let's take a look!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"24BR HordeMode 1 Social\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/24br-hordemode-1-social-1920x1080-16d1f49b98b8.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nHot Map Update</h2>\n\n<p>In the latest edition of Survive the Horde, you won\u2019t always be moving to the same bases as before. For example, a new base location has appeared at the Volcano!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAlso, the gnome rave from last time got broken up, so they\u2019ve found a new place to party.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nWave Updates</h2>\n\n<p>We updated the balance and order of waves in Survive the Horde, and added some new ones for you to discover.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAlso, as wave difficulty increases, you\u2019ll also have less time between waves to prepare \u2014 so don\u2019t dally!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nFinal Wave Holdout</h3>\n\n<p>Get ready for the grand finale\u2026 There\u2019s now a <strong>\u201cfinal wave\u201d</strong>! Survive the horde for five minutes at the end of a mission while you wait for Homebase to pull you out.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nUnlock Difficulty Tiers</h2>\n\n<p>Survive The Horde now has multiple difficulty tiers. Complete a tier, and the next difficulty will unlock. Can you overcome Tier 5?<br />\n<br />\nUnlock new Banner Icons and Sprays as you complete these difficulties!<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nChallenge Week Schedule</h2>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve adjusted the order of Challenge Weeks compared to Survive The Horde\u2019s debut run, and added some more. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what to expect week-to-week this Venture Season!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nChallenge Week 1 - Storm Surge</h3>\n\n<p>The safe zones within the Storm are now smaller. Lightning strikes frequently target the team, giving players and Husks alike a nasty zap!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 2 - Low Gravity</h3>\n\n<p>The magnetic field has shifted, rendering Hoverboards inoperable and changing the effects of gravity. Jump higher and move faster as your melee attacks knock back the hordes of Husks.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 3 - Melee Mayhem</h3>\n\n<p>Ranged weapons and ammo from Supply Drops are limited, and any ranged attacks made against Husks will ricochet off and also damage you. But on the bright side, your Trap damage and melee attack speed will be boosted, so put away those guns, craft some extra Traps, and start swingin\u2019!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 4 - Hasty Husks</h3>\n\n<p>You\u2019re in a jam: damaging and eliminating enemies will just make the horde move in more quickly. Even worse, if they get close enough to start damaging you, they\u2019ll start healing themselves! Focus fire to try to take them out quickly (and preferably at a distance).</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 5 - Windswept</h3>\n\n<p>Hold onto your hats! It\u2019s getting gusty out here, threatening players with a rash of tornadoes.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 6 - Slow Burn&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>Feel the burn as Husks drop an acid pool after being eliminated. Beware of the Husks\u2019 attacks inflicting you with a slowing status effect, making avoiding the acid pools tricky!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 7 - Unflappable Husks&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>The Horde has become unstoppable, ignoring all crowd control effects. Try and avoid their attacks as they now leave a lingering damage effect when they hit you! To help you out, your Sniper, Assault Rifle, SMG, Shotgun, and Pistol damage have been increased, and Traps have become more lethal. Use your newfound power to keep the Horde at bay!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 8 - Fast Forward&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>The waves of enemies are making their way faster than ever, meaning you\u2019ll have less time to build and gather Supply Drops. But don\u2019t let intimidation slow you down \u2014 move fast and get things done in this race against time to Survive the Horde.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 9 - Smog of War&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>The volcano\u2019s starting to erupt! A thick cloud of ash coats the area, reducing visibility significantly. Our radar is not functioning properly, so enemies won\u2019t appear on the map!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 10 - The Floor is Lava&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>The volcano\u2019s in full erupt mode. Staying in contact with the ground for too long will cause a damaging lava eruption below your feet! Keep on the move or take refuge at an elevated position to avoid these perilous hazards.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 11 - Not-Space Rocks</h3>\n\n<p>Defend your bases and keep your eyes in the skies for falling volcanic debris from above, hot stepper!</p>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
