# Blurl obtaining
Steps to reach blurl for the streaming

## Step 1
Select a song from the Fortnite Content API list

Spark tracks page: `https://fortnitecontent-website-prod07.ol.epicgames.com/content/api/pages/fortnite-game/spark-tracks`

As an example I have selected:

```"dontfearthereaper":{"_title":"dontfearthereaper","track":{"tt":"(Don't Fear) The Reaper","nu":"2024-03-28T23:00:00.000Z","ry":1976,"dn":322,"sib":"Bass","sid":"Drum","sig":"Guitar","qi":"{\"sid\":\"aa4f6195-5070-42cc-afaf-55db3d61bba8\",\"pid\":\"3f7619fe-66b9-48d4-94a7-3f94189c4b67\",\"title\":\"dontfearthereaper\",\"tracks\":[{\"part\":\"ds\",\"channels\":[\"FL\",\"FR\"],\"vols\":[4,4]},{\"part\":\"bs\",\"channels\":[\"FL\",\"FR\"],\"vols\":[4,4]},{\"part\":\"gs\",\"channels\":[\"FL\",\"FR\"],\"vols\":[4,4]},{\"part\":\"vs\",\"channels\":[\"FL\",\"FR\"],\"vols\":[4,4]},{\"part\":\"fs\",\"channels\":[\"FL\",\"FR\"],\"vols\":[4,4]}],\"preview\":{\"starttime\":30.4018}}","sn":"dontfearthereaper","ge":["Rock"],"mk":"A","mm":"Minor","ab":"Agents of Fortune","siv":"Vocals","su":"75d14ea0-99b6-41a6-8c68-bca89bddded7","in":{"pb":2,"pd":5,"vl":2,"pg":4,"_type":"SparkTrackIntensities","gr":5,"ds":6,"ba":5},"mt":141,"_type":"SparkTrack","mu":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/w2ew41kecdgxucto-0a3c19befbf4.dat","an":"Blue Ã–yster Cult","gt":["Jam-LoopIsUnpitched-Beat"],"ar":"E","au":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/ctzomncwaembo4i9-512x512-4f2be6de1f0e.png","ti":"SparksSong:sid_placeholder_20","ld":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/dontfearthereaper-b6164b6c8410.lad","jc":"3969-4510-2918"},"_noIndex":false,"_activeDate":"2023-10-09T21:22:07.220Z","lastModified":"2024-03-19T15:20:54.542Z","_locale":"en-US","_templateName":"track"}```

Don't Fear The Reaper by Blue Oyster

## Step 2
Extract `sid` (Song Streaming ID) from `qi` (for Preview use `pid`)

`aa4f6195-5070-42cc-afaf-55db3d61bba8` is our Song Streaming ID

## Step 3
Join Streaming CDN URL with our Song Streaming ID

`https://cdn.qstv.on.epicgames.com/` is our Streaming CDN service

When joined by `aa4f6195-5070-42cc-afaf-55db3d61bba8` we are resulted with:

`https://cdn.qstv.on.epicgames.com/aa4f6195-5070-42cc-afaf-55db3d61bba8`

This URL does not require Authentication.

## Step 4
### Obtaining Blurl (to obtain MPD directly skip to step 5)
Obtain Blurl URL

In the content returned by `https://cdn.qstv.on.epicgames.com/aa4f6195-5070-42cc-afaf-55db3d61bba8` we have a few values:

```{"playlist":"This is actually already the MPD just encoded in Base64 format","playlistType":"application/dash+xml","metadata":{"assetId":"","baseUrls":["https://fortnite-vod.akamaized.net/yZUGFgMbTQzURFyVgh/1706206034/","https://pilgrim.qstv.on.epicgames.com/yZUGFgMbTQzURFyVgh/1706206034/"],"supportsCaching":true,"version":"1706206034"}}```

`metadata.baseUrls` contains 2 URLs: 

- `https://fortnite-vod.akamaized.net/yZUGFgMbTQzURFyVgh/1706206034/`
- `https://pilgrim.qstv.on.epicgames.com/yZUGFgMbTQzURFyVgh/1706206034/`

(Note: these urls cycle a lot, most likely to avoid high loads on the servers)

We can see `/1706206034/` is common across both.

On the first URL we see a structure

`https://fortnite-vod.akamaized.net/:VUIDPath/:UnixDate/`

To obtain a blurl we must not use the Unix timestamp and instead replace it with `master.blurl`.

For our song, this would be:

`https://fortnite-vod.akamaized.net/yZUGFgMbTQzURFyVgh/master.blurl`

We have now obtained our blurl.

## Step 5
### Obtaining MPD directly

We can use the `playlist` value in the returned content by `https://cdn.qstv.on.epicgames.com/:sid` and decode it from base64 to get our MPD content directly, or...

using our previously declared structure (`https://fortnite-vod.akamaized.net/:VUIDPath/:UnixDate/`) we join `main.mpd` to our URL.

For our song this would be:

`https://fortnite-vod.akamaized.net/yZUGFgMbTQzURFyVgh/1706206034/main.mpd`

We have obtained our MPEG-Dash playlist.
